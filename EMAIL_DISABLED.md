# ✅ Email Functionality Disabled

## Changes Made:
- **Contact Form**: Email notifications disabled
- **Prayer Requests**: Email notifications disabled  
- **SMTP Settings**: Commented out in `.env`

## What Still Works:
✅ Contact form saves messages to database
✅ Prayer requests save to database
✅ Admin can view all submissions
✅ Users see success messages

## What's Disabled:
❌ No email notifications to admin
❌ No confirmation emails to users
❌ No prayer team notifications

## To Re-enable Later:
1. Uncomment SMTP settings in `.env`
2. Change `if (false &&` back to `if (` in contact.js and prayers.js
3. Set SMTP_USER and SMTP_PASS values

**Website is ready for deployment without email functionality.**
